DOMAIN:â€œFULL STACK WEB DEVELOPMENT"
DURATION:10Th JUNE 2024 to 10Th JULY 2024

Project Overview: To-Do List Application
Project Structure:

  Files:
      index.html: Contains the structure of the webpage, including input fields, buttons, and the task list.
      styles.css: Defines the styles for the webpage, including layout, colors, fonts, and background image.
      scripts.js: Implements the dynamic functionality of the to-do list, such as adding tasks, marking them as completed, deleting tasks, and storing tasks in local storage.
  Functionality:
      Adding Tasks:

        Users can input new tasks in the text field and press "Add" or hit Enter to add them to the list.
        Tasks are dynamically added to the unordered list (<ul>).
  Completing Tasks:

        Each task item has a checkbox that users can toggle to mark tasks as completed.
        Completed tasks are visually indicated with a strikethrough text style.
  Deleting Tasks:

        Each task item has a "Delete" button that removes the task from the list when clicked.
  Local Storage:

        Tasks are stored locally using browser's localStorage.
        Saved tasks persist across page reloads, allowing users to revisit the page and see their previously entered tasks.
  Technologies Used:

        HTML5: Provides the structure of the webpage, defining elements such as input fields, buttons, and lists.
        CSS3: Styles the webpage for a visually appealing and responsive design, including layout, colors, and background image.
        JavaScript (ES6+): Implements the dynamic behavior of the to-do list, handling user interactions, updating the DOM, and managing local storage.
        Local Storage: Stores tasks locally in the browser, allowing data persistence between sessions without the need for a backend server.
        Responsive Design: Uses flexbox and media queries to ensure the application adapts well to different screen sizes and devices.
  User Experience:

        Intuitive Interface: Simple and user-friendly interface for adding, completing, and deleting tasks.
        Visual Feedback: Immediate visual feedback when tasks are added, completed, or deleted.
        Persistent Data: Tasks are saved locally, providing a seamless user experience across multiple visits to the webpage.
        Enhancements and Future Considerations:

  Additional Features: Expand functionality with features like task prioritization, due dates, or categories.
  Accessibility: Ensure the application is accessible to users with disabilities by adhering to web accessibility standards.
  Performance Optimization: Improve performance for larger task lists or slower devices.
  Cross-Browser Compatibility: Test and ensure compatibility with various web browsers to reach a broader audience.
  
  Conclusion:
        This to-do list project demonstrates fundamental web development techniques using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive and practical application. By leveraging local storage, the application provides a lightweight yet functional solution for managing tasks directly in the user's browser. As a foundational project, it can be expanded and enhanced further based on specific user needs and additional feature requirements.
